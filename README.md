The idea of the project is to create a website that will serve as a platform for students and prospective students. The website will feature a list of universities with detailed information about each institution, including data on faculties, study programs, admission requirements, tuition fees, and other important aspects. The main goal of the project is to create a convenient and informative resource for those seeking information about universities and in need of advice on admission and education.
